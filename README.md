## Want to Contribute?
I am currently looking for empires with a *Habitat*, *Remnant*, or *Ringworld* origin to add to the mod. I more specifically am looking for at least empire and species names and a good bio for them. I also am accepting empires outiside of that scope as well, so feel free to suggest them as well.

**[Post your empire suggestions here](https://github.com/Adventurer13/JustMoreEmpires-StellarisImmortal/issues/1)**

## Credits
All credit goes to [EdFromEarth](https://steamcommunity.com/id/edfromearth) for [Just More Empires](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1364760456), which I highly suggest using when not using Stellaris Immortal.
